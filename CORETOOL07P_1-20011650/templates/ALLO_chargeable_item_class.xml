Template of the ALLO chargeable item class

Use:
This chargeable item class is used by SAP CRM to request the creation of allowances in SAP CC.

Procedure:
1 - Update the property ${catalog} with the name of the catalog in which you want to import this chargeable item class.
Note: Only one ALLO chargeable item class can exist in a SAP CC system. It is not possible to import this chargeable item
class in two different catalogs.
2 - Import this template in SAP CC via the Core Tool (File > Import)
3 - Build the charge creating the allowances on response of chargeable items of this class.

Note:
If you need to store the corresponding consumption items in SAP CI, you have to create the same consumption item class in SAP CI.
